### Sourdough base
- 50g / 50ml feeding ratio
- throw out half and feed every 12-24h (depends on the type of flour)

### Recipe
- [evening] prepare the sourdough starter with 10g / 50g / 50ml ratio
- [evening] prepare the bread base with 500g* / 350ml ratio (autolyse)
- [morning] add 100g/10g of sourdough starter / salt ratio to the bread base
- [evening] form the dough and leave it covered in the basket for ~1hr, afterwards leave it in the fridge till the morning
- [morning] score the dough and bake it in the over for 30min covered and ~18min uncovered at 230Â°C

### Tips
- I use rye flour for the sourdough base (can be wholemeal)
- use bread flour with 10-12g of protein
- I usually begin the process in the evening, so that I can bake it in the morning
- for the bread base I use [Caputo](https://caputoflour.com/); I combine 350g of wheat flour with 150g of wholewheat flour
